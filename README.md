👋 Hi, I’m @AleSambru

I am a Master’s student in Physics at the University of Milan, with a focus on Biophysics and Systems Biology. I am currently developing my Master’s thesis at IFOM (Milan). My interests center on quantitative approaches to biological complexity and the modeling of emergent behavior in living systems.

### Research Interests
- Biophysics of molecular and cellular systems  
- Systems biology and regulatory network dynamics  
- Statistical mechanics applied to biological organization  

### Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Currently improving proficiency in **C++** and **Python** for scientific computing and simulation  
- **Methods:** numerical simulation, and data analysis
